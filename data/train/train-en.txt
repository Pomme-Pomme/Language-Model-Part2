<s> people 's concerns over noise pollution , as we approach the third millennium , as shown by the latest surveys published by the euro-barometer , are on the increase . </s>
<s> this must be set against the statement in the european charter of fundamental rights to the effect that ' collective expulsions are prohibited . ' </s>
